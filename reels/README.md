## Config

All keybinds are configurable. Each action supports multiple binds. Open/close pairs can be bound to the same key to toggle.

The config TUI is a wrapper for `~/.config/reels/reels.conf` (which may also be edited by hand):

```bash
reels --config
```

**See [CONFIG.md](https://github.com/njyeung/reels/blob/main/CONFIG.md) for the full list of settings and their defaults.**

## File paths

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Settings | `~/.config/reels/reels.conf` |
| Cache | `~/.cache/reels/` |
| Browser data | `~/.local/share/reels/` |
| Logs | `~/.local/state/reels/reels.log` |


## Pre-built Binaries
Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/njyeung/reels/releases):

| Platform | Binary |
|----------|--------|
| Linux (x86_64) | `reels-linux-amd64` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `reels-linux-arm64` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `reels-darwin-arm64` |

## Building from source (For Developers)

Requires Go 1.25+ and FFmpeg 8+ development libraries.

Pre-built binaries ship with FFmpeg statically linked. For development, dynamically linking against a system FFmpeg makes building and iteration faster (simply `go build -o reels`). You can still build using docker, but I highly recommend installing the correct versions of FFmpeg following the directions below:

**macOS:** Requires `ffmpeg-full` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (`brew install ffmpeg-full`), [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/ffmpeg/), or FFmpeg 8+ built from [source](https://github.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg). The standard `brew install ffmpeg` is missing required framework link flags.

**Linux:** Requires FFmpeg 8+ development libraries from your package manager (e.g. `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg` on Arch, `sudo apt install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu). This usually works fine as long as your packages are updated.

```bash
# brew install ffmpeg-full      on macOS
# sudo apt install ffmpeg       on Linux
# ffmpeg -version               should be 8+
git clone https://github.com/njyeung/reels.git
cd reels
go build -o reels .
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>My terminal shows no video at all</b></summary>

<br>

It is likely that your terminal does not properly support the **Kitty graphics protocol**. See [Terminal](#Terminal).

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>"could not complete initial sync" on startup</b></summary>

<br>

Almost always means the saved session didn't stick, even if you clicked **Save Info**.

Diagnose by relaunching with the browser visible:

```bash
reels --headed
```

If the window is sitting on an Instagram login screen, log in and click **Save Info** again.

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Linux ARM64: Chrome doesn't download</b></summary>

<br>

Chrome is automatically downloaded on first run if no system Chrome/Chromium is found; No action is needed for most platforms. The exception is Linux ARM64, where Chrome For Testing isn't available yet ([coming Q2 2026!](https://blog.chromium.org/2026/03/bringing-chrome-to-arm64-linux-devices.html)).

On Linux ARM64, install Chrome, Chromium, or Brave manually before running Reels.

</details>


<details><summary><b>High CPU usage</b></summary>

<br>

Try using one of the [recommended terminals](#terminal). These terminals support reading image data from a shared memory object rather than having Reels TUI base64 encode and print it to stdout.

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Nothing works</b></summary>

<br>

Sometimes, the Chrome profile may be left in an unrecoverable state. Wipe the chrome-data and restart:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/reels/
reels
```
